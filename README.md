# 🧠 Symbolic Detection Lab

A real-time symbolic collapse detection framework powered by the **LIFE–PHI operator**, planetary modeling, and space static alignment. This suite enables motif rendering, null-model calibration, and geomagnetic forecast fusion — designed for researchers, analysts, and systems engineers exploring symbolic entropy and planetary influence.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **LIFE–PHI Operator**: Detects symbolic collapse events using latent field interactions.
- **Planetary Modeling**: Integrates orbital data and geomagnetic vectors.
- **Motif Rendering**: Visualizes collapse motifs across temporal and spatial scales.
- **Null-Model Calibration**: Benchmarks detection accuracy against randomized baselines.
- **Forecast Fusion**: Combines geomagnetic forecasts with symbolic entropy metrics.
